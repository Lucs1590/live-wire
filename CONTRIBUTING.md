We welcome and support contributions. Here is a list of tasks to do:

* Undo the previous edge made
* Apply cython to achieve faster results
* Remove press and hold mouse click and replace with single clicks (better interface)
* Select a point and click to get segementated part, now the last point should become first point and we will only need to click once for the second segmentation
* Make the white border thicker (Perferably depending on the size of image)
